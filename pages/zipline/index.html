        </h2>
        <!--process and discovery-->
        <p class="space-vertical-sm">During business development and user research for a seperate application at Zline, I learned that small businesses were suffering due to the rise of review-based apps such as Yelp and FourSquare. Small businesses had a desire to perserve their brand image, and they found social platforms such as Instagram to be valuable for their brand. Unfortunately, these social platforms are not meant to be a business discoverability platform like Yelp. I developed the concept and UX of this business discoverability application which is a hybrid of apps such as Instagram, Squarespace and Yelp. Reviews would be replaced by "shout-outs" which works like an upvote with no comments, and the small businesses would be able to build and customize their pages to fit closest to their brand. Consumers would be able to scroll through beautiful listings by location and develop lists of businesses to visit in the future. This concept has been validated with the select small businesses I was speaking with.</p>
